    "Explanation of the steps:\n",
    "- Before execution of the argument function, we want `print('Hi … Starting execution')` to be executed, so we write it before `fn()`, and after execution of the function, we want `print('Bye … Finished execution\\n')` to be executed, so we write it after `fn()`.\n",
    "- we have reassigned the name `func1` with the return value of the decorator, so after this statement, `func1` no longer refers to the `function object` created by `def func1()`. Instead, it refers to the `function object` created by the `def wrapper()` statement. \n",
    "- Now, when we call `func1`, the `wrapper function` will be executed, which calls the original function i.e, func1 as well as the additional code, and so we will get the decorated output.\n",
    "- <span style='background-color:red'>**Properties of functions that are being used:**</span> \n",
    "    - <span style='background-color:yellow'>The function my_decorator is being assigned to a variable func1.</span>\n",
    "    - <span style='background-color:yellow'>The function func1 is being passed as an argument to the function my_decorator.</span>\n",
    "    - <span style='background-color:yellow'>The function wrapper is being returned by the function my_decorator.</span>\n",
    "    - <span style='background-color:yellow'> Wrapper function is a closure, which has access to and remembers the parameter fn of the outer function, even after the outer function my_decorator has finished executing.</span>"
