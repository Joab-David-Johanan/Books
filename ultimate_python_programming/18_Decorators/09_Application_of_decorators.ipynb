    "- Decorators are **reuseable** pieces of code, that can be used to extend the functionality of multiple functions.\n",
    "- We have seen that we can use decorators to `calculate the time` -> **that a function takes to execute** , for `logging function calls` -> **to a file or to some other location** and for `counting function calls`.\n",
    "- You can add `debugging information` to the function, for example you can write a decorator to show what `arguments were passed` to the function and what was the `return value`.\n",
    "- Decorators can be used to `check for prerequisites` before a function executes. For example, you can write decorators that can\n",
    "check the argument types or values.\n",
    "- By using decorators, you can ensure that the `arguments are of specific type` or  `are in a certain limit`. You can even\n",
    "`sanitize/change` the format of the arguments before they are passed to the function.\n",
    "- <span style='background-color:yellow'>**You can create decorators to check for authentication and access privileges**. Django which is a popular web framework, uses the **@login_required** and **@permissions_required** decorators for checking the login status and permissions of the user before viewing a specific web page.</span>\n",
